# What?

It fills your ipod with songs, dude.

# How do I use it

You get this code, add it to your path (either with PATH= or bashrc, whatever), and then run 'ipod'. You may have to edit it to change mountpoints, directories to read, etc. If you have ways to make it better, feel free to fork/pull req.
